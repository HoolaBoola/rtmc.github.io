## Create tmc account

Follow the instructions in [this guide](http://testmycode-usermanual.github.io/usermanual/teachers.html) to create a test my code account which allows you to link the exercises to the course.

## Creating a course repository

To create a tmc-course for R, you will need to create a git repository. This will contain exercise folders that serve as the basis for students' code for the exercises. Also in this repository you can write the tests for each exercise to check if students' code runs correctly.

There are couple of ways to create a repository. If you know your way around git, feel free to do it however you prefer to.

One easy way to create a git repository is using GitHub, which is a repository hosting service.

First, sign up / log in to [GitHub](https://github.com).

After logging on, you'll see the GitHub front page and (somewhere there) a big green button saying *new repository*. Click it.

Fill in the needed fields. The repository needs a name at least.

And here it is, an empty repository. Now you can begin adding exerises.

# Rstudio

To use RTMC, you'll need Rstudio IDE. You can find it
[here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/).

Download the desktop version of the software for the operation system of your choice and install it.
